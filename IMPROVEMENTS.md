## 🔧 Bug Fixes

### 1. **Profile Update/Add Logic**
**Issue:** The condition was reversed
- When profile existed → called _addProfile (wrong)
- When no profile → called _updateProfile (wrong)

**Fix:** Corrected the conditional logic
```dart
if(profileData.isNotEmpty) {
  await _updateProfile(...) // Now correct
} else {
  await _addProfile(...)    // Now correct
}
```
